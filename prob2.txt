1:  Dot_product procedure:
    To calculate the dot product of two vectors,
    we need to multiply the corresponding elements of the vectors and sum them up:

    we start be declaring our variables:
    n = v.length() // Assuming both vectors have the same length.
    ps = 0 // Initialize the dot product variable to zero.

    We loop through the vectors, for i to n-1:
    ps = ps + v1[i] * v2[i] // Multiply corresponding elements and add to the dot product variable.



2:  Checking if vectors are orthogonal:
    To check if two vectors are orthogonal we call the dot_product procedure.
    We use a nested loop to iterate over pairs of vectors.

    n = vectors.length() // Number of vector pairs.

    for i to n=1:
    v1 = vectors[i][0] // first vector in the pair
    v2 = vectors[i][1] // second vector in the pair

    Then we call the dot_product procedure, if ps = 0 --> vectors are orthogonal.

3:  To modify the procedure to be a function instead:
    we should return the value ps instead of storing it inside a variable.
